# School-cyber-course-final-project
This repository contains the code and documantation of my final project in my high school cyber course.
The project is an alarm button program for the deaf with a written text and video chat.
Note: The documantation of this project is almost entirely in hebrew.
All the code in the project was written in python 2.7.11.
